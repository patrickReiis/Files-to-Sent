## Note
The original purpose of this project was to create a REST API that is able to send files to users in whatsapp. From what I've searched however the Whatsapp API isn't free so instead I decided to use a telegram bot (which is free). 
The only limitation that a telegram bot has is that it can't initiate conversations so if you want to test this project you or your users will have to send a message to the telegram bot first, but it will be explained later in detail.


## Create database
```
$ psql postgres

postgres=# CREATE DATABASE filestosent;
postgres=# \q
```

## Setup enviorement variables
Inside the root directory create a **config/dev.env** file.
The .env file requires the following structure:
```
PORT=3000
NODEMAILER_EMAIL=
NODEMAILER_EMAIL_PASSWORD=
BOT_KEY=
DATABASE_USERNAME=
DATABASE_PASSWORD=
```

* You can generate a BOT_KEY with the [Bot Father](https://t.me/botfather)
* To generate the NODEMAILER_EMAIL_PASSWORD you need to enable Two-factor authentication in your google account and [generate a password with it](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en). If you don't have a google account find a way to connect with less secure apps with your email provider.

## Install dependencies
```
$ npm install
```


## Run the application 
```
$ npm run dev
```

## How to use (in order)
First you need to create an account:
* **localhost:3000/api/register** | Method: POST | Body Format: JSON | JSON Format: {"username":"<your-username>", "email":"<your-email>", "password1":"<your-password>", "password2": "<your-password>"}

Then you will recieve an email with a confirmation link to validate your account, the **confirm** key of the **query parameter** will always be a sequence of random numbers.
* **localhost:3000/api/verify?confirm=< sequence of random numbers >** | Method: GET 

Now you can log-in, if everything goes right in this process you will recieve a **sessionid cookie**.
* **localhost:3000/api/login** | Method: POST | Body Format: JSON | JSON Format: {"email":"<your-email>", "password": "<your-password>"}

Now you can send files to the users attached to your bot:
* **localhost:3000/api/v1/sendAll** | Method: POST | Body Format: JSON | JSON Format: {"url":"<your-url>"}

## Making users attach to your account
As I said in the Note section bots in Telegram cannot start conversations so you need to send a link of your bot to the users you want to send the files and they need to click in the 'start' button.
  
You can send any of those URLs to your users: 
* https://t.me/< your bot name >_bot | Recommended 
* https://web.telegram.org/k/#@< your bot name >_bot | Works only in web telegram
  
Once your users press the button start, they will recieve some instructions of commands available in the bot chat.
You also need to **say your username** to your uses so they can use the /get command in the bot chat.
  
## Final Note
  I hope you found this project interesting, I'm still a begginner in programming but I will keep doing projects until I become good (and hopefully get a job)
  
  Espero que tenha achado interessante esse projeto, eu ainda sou um iniciante mas irei continuar fazendo projetos at√© eu ficar bom (e conseguir um trabalho)
